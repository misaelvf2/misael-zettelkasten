# Complete Search

Complete Search is a general approach to algorithm design in which the entire search space is explored in order to determine the best solution, or to count the number of solutions.

Complete search is also called "brute force search."

Complete search is characterized by its simplicity. A complete search approach is often the first kind of solution that we may come up with when presented with a problem. However, it is often-times a suboptimal solution.

In the event that a complete search solution is unsatisfactory (i.e., its time complexity is too slow), we may turn to more sophisticated approaches, such as [[Dynamic Programming|dynamic programming]], [[Greedy Algorithms|greedy algorithms]], or some other approach that relies on particular properties of the data that is being searched (for instance, [[Binary Search|binary search]] when the elements define a total ordering property.)
